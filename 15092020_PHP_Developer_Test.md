### General information
---
This is a take-home technical test. This should take a few hours. But feel free to work on it at your own pace. 

**Closing Date: 24 September 2020**

### Problem Description
---

Make a to-do list app in which the user can add daily tasks to be accomplished. 

Some pointers to keep in mind while building the to-do list app are:

- Users should authenticate into the app using their email address and password
- Upon login, users should see, hightlighted, the todo's that are due on the current day
- User should be able to add a new item todo item to the list.
- The items added should be visible to the user in the to-do list and should be persisted to the database via your API
- User should be able to mark a task in the list as ‘completed’. The completed tasks can appear under a separate category for more organised layout.
- Users should be able to edit or delete a task from a list which updates, 
- Display date and time of when a particular task item was added to the to-do list.
- When a user clicks on a todo item, a pop up modal should appear with the details of the todo item. 
- The UI should entirely be built using Vue. With the Vue app pulling data from an API that you build
- Each todo item should have the following fields - (title, description, date created, date/time due)

### Constraints
---

The application should be built using Laravel 7 or 8. And Vue 2 or 3 beta. 

Try to write as much of your code as you can without depending on too many composer & npm packages
